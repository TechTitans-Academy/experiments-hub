# ðŸš€ Application Overview: Flask + Redis Counter

This is a minimal web application designed to demonstrate container communication in Docker Compose. It's perfect for learning purposes because:

- It's simple but interactive.
- It showcases service-to-service communication.
- It uses a lightweight cache-based counter (Redis) instead of a database.


### ðŸ”¹ How it Works

Flask Web App (web container):

- Serves a simple HTTP route (/).
- On each visit, it connects to Redis and increments a counter.
- Returns the number of visits in the response.
- Redis (redis container):
- Acts as an in-memory key-value store.
- Stores a single key hits that tracks how many times the page was visited.
